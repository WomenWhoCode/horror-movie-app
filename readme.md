We're currently designing an app that recommends horror movies to you according to user-specified preferences.  
  
#Development Stages 
0: Design/mockups  
1: Build app infrastructure - unstyled UI (user sets filters), sql/node backend (?)  
2: Style app  
3: Add wiki elements - user accounts, allow users to add db entries (depends on stage 1 decisions), add tags (independent of flagging)  

#Attribute possibilities
- level of gore
- (aesthetic attributes: fashion, music, set design, lighting)
- death count
- era
- region/language
- adaptation
- subgenre

#Flag possibilities
- strong female character
- remake
- vamipirism/werewolfery/etc.  

#Legality
How illegal are we being?
