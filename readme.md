We're currently designing an app that recommends horror movies to you according to user-specified preferences.  
  
#Development Stages 
0: Design/mockups  
1: Build app infrastructure - unstyled UI (user sets filters), emberjs - nodejs - mysql 
2: Style app  
3: Add wiki elements - user accounts, allow users to add db entries (depends on stage 1 decisions), add tags (independent of flagging)
