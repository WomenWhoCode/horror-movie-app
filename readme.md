We're currently designing an app that recommends horror movies to you according to user-specified preferences.  
  
#Development Stages 

0: Design/mockups  
1: mysql installation, db design based on alisen's spreadsheet  
2: pull TMDB data (depending on API, we may not have to use OpenRefine)  
3: UX design / wireframe  
4: nodejs  
5: psd - emberjs  
6: Extra Credit: Add wiki elements - user accounts, allow users to add db entries (depends on stage 1 decisions), add tags (independent of flagging)
