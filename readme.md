We're currently designing an app that recommends horror movies to you according to user-specified preferences.  
  
##Development Stages##  
0: Design/mockups  
1: Build app infrastructure - unstyled UI (user sets filters), sql/node backend (?)
2: Style app
3: Add wiki elements - user accounts, allow users to add db entries (depends on stage 1 decisions), add tags (independent of flagging)
